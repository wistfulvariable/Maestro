Encore Features are Maestro's system for shipping powerful capabilities that aren't essential for every user. They're disabled by default and completely invisible when off — no shortcuts, no menu items, no command palette entries. This keeps the core app lean while letting power users opt into advanced workflows.

Think of them as a precursor to a full plugin marketplace: each Encore Feature adds significant functionality, but only for users who want it.

## Enabling Encore Features

Open **Settings** (`Cmd+,` / `Ctrl+,`) and navigate to the **Encore Features** tab. Toggle individual features on or off. Each feature may have its own configuration options that appear when enabled.

## For Developers

Want to build a new Encore Feature? The architecture is designed for easy extension — add a flag, wire up the toggle, gate the access points, and your feature ships behind a clean opt-in.

See the [Encore Features contributor guide](https://github.com/RunMaestro/Maestro/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#encore-features-feature-gating) for the full implementation checklist, architecture details, and the canonical reference implementation (Director's Notes).
