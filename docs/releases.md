## v0.15.x - Maestro Symphony

**Latest: v0.15.1** | Released March 3, 2026

🎶 Maestro Symphony - Contribute to open source with AI assistance! Browse curated issues from projects with the `runmaestro.ai` label, clone repos with one click, and automatically process the relevant Auto Run playbooks. Track your contributions, streaks, and stats. You're contributing CPU and tokens towards your favorite open-source projects and features. NOTE: Making changes here active based on user feedback 🙏

🎬 Director's Notes. Aggregates history across all agents into a unified timeline with search, filters, and an activity graph. Includes an AI Overview tab that generates a structured synopsis of recent work. Off by default, gated behind a new "Encore Features" panel under settings. This is a precursor to an eventual plugin system. Allowing for extensions and customizations without bloating the core app.

🏷️ Conductor Profile - Available under Settings > General. Provide a short description on how Maestro agents should interface with you.

🧠 Three-State Thinking Toggle - The thinking toggle now cycles through three modes: off, on, and sticky. Sticky mode keeps thinking content visible after the response completes. Cycle with CMD/CTRL+SHIFT+K ⌨️ (#165).

🤖 Factory.ai Droid Support - Added support for the [Factory.ai](https://factory.ai/product/cli) droid agent. Full session management and output parsing integration (#223).

🔧 Windows and SSH Stability Improvements - Major fixes for remote agent execution including wizard support, synopsis generation, and proper shell profile sourcing across platforms. (#131, #156, #159, #187, #195).

## v0.12.x - Thinking, Spec-Kits, Context Management

**Latest: v0.12.3** | Released December 28, 2025

The big changes in the v0.12.x line are the following three:

## Show Thinking

🤔 There is now a toggle to show thinking for the agent, the default for new tabs is off, though this can be changed under Settings > General. The toggle shows next to History and Read-Only. Very similar pattern. This has been the #1 most requested feature, though personally, I don't think I'll use it as I prefer to not see the details of the work, but the results of the work. Just as we work with our colleagues.

## GitHub Spec-Kit Integration

🎯 Added [GitHub Spec-Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) commands into Maestro with a built-in updater to grab the latest prompts from the repository. We do override `/speckit-implement` (the final step) to create Auto Run docs and guide the user through their execution, which thanks to Wortrees from v0.11.x allows us to run in parallel!

## Context Management Tools

📖 Added context management options from tab right-click menu. You can now compress, merge, and transfer contexts between agents. You will received (configurable) warnings at 60% and 80% context consumption with a hint to compact.

## Changes Specific to v0.12.3:

- We now have hosted documentation through Mintlify 📚
- Export any tab conversation as self-contained themed HTML file 📄
- Publish files as private/public Gists 🌐
- Added tab hover overlay menu with close operations and export 📋
- Added social handles to achievement share images 🏆

### Previous Releases in this Series

- **v0.12.1** (December 27, 2025) - Thinking, Spec-Kits, Context Management
- **v0.12.0** (December 25, 2025) - Thinking, Spec-Kits, Context Management

## v0.11.x - Worktrees

**Latest: v0.11.0** | Released December 22, 2025

🌳 GitHub Worktree support was added. Any agent bound to a Git repository has the option to enable worktrees, each of which show up as a sub-agent with their own write-lock and Auto Run capability. Now you can truly develop in parallel on the same project and issue PRs when you're ready, all from within Maestro. Huge improvement, major thanks to @petersilberman.

# Other Changes

- @ file mentions now include documents from your Auto Run folder (which may not live in your agent working directory) 🗄️
- The wizard is now capable of detecting and continuing on past started projects 🧙
- Bug fixes 🐛🐜🐞
