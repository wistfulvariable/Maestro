 * tourSteps.tsx
 *
 * Defines the tour step sequence and configuration for the onboarding tour.
 * Each step includes selector information for spotlighting elements,
 * title/description content, and UI state requirements.
 *
 * Steps have two description variants:
 * - description: Used when tour is launched from the wizard (Auto Run context)
 * - descriptionGeneric: Used when tour is launched from hamburger menu (general context)
 *
 * Descriptions can include shortcut placeholders like {{shortcutId}} which will be
 * replaced with the user's configured keyboard shortcut at runtime.
 *
 * Steps can also include descriptionContent/descriptionContentGeneric for JSX
 * content that renders inline icons matching the actual UI.
